The main goal of the project is to elucidate the effect of micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) in male gonads of Atlantic salmon from a genetic and epigenetic point of view.

Micronutrients may affect DNA methylation profiles inter-generationally (two generations) and trans-generationally (multiple generations).

To investigate potential inheritance mechanisms of DNA methylation through the male germ line, we collected male gonad samples from a whole life cycle feeding trial (over 54 weeks) of Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*). The trial was conducted under the EU funded [ARRAINA](https://www.arraina.eu/){: .btn} (advanced research initiatives for nutrition and aquaculture) project.

The next page [project summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/project-summary/){: .btn} presents more detailed project description with the experimental design, followed by a summary of our main findings.
